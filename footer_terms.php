        <p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.</li>
            <p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
          <li>Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.</li>
            <p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
          <li>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.</li>
            <p>Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
          <li>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.</li>
            <p>Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.</p>
          <li>Ensuring access to our Service.</li>
            <p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.</p>
          <li>Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.</li>
            <p>We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
          <li>Research and innovation.</li>
            <p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Our agreement and what happens if we disagree</h3>
        <h4>Our agreement.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</li>
          <li>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</li>
          <li>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</li>
          <li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Who has rights under this agreement.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</li>
          <li>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.</li>
          <li>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Who is responsible if something happens.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Our Service is provided "as is", and we can't guarantee that it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</li>
          <li>We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.</li>
          <li>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know that they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information or account.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How we will handle disputes.</h4>
        <p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim that we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.</p>
        <h4>Unsolicited material.</h4>
        <p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
